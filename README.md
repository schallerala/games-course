During this course, we create a team, Arseny and Alain, to create a text based 

## Story line
#### Based on "Edge of Tomorrow" and "Escape the room"
We are a colonel for the United Forces of Earth. We are doing promotion to join our force to fight the Alien invasion. We are doing appearancesâ€™ on TV and Ad's. After couple of weeks of raging war, we are asked by a general to make a point about our promotion. Things end up badly, and tell us that we will be joining the front-lines in 2 days. we try to escape all this, by leaving the office but are hit by a car when we get out of the building...


We wake up at a military station somewhere in UK. A sergeant comes to pick up and brings us to our new comrades and don't believe we are actually a colonel. He reply to this "joke" by reading our files and quotes: "Try to desert".
When we enter the room with our new buddies, they were betting money on a card game, try to hid it because the sergeant would punish them. He still finds out and make them eat pieces of the cards.

The next day, time to get in the aircraft to jump over France that is already totally invaded. We get hit, we lose half of the plane and we can escape and parachute to the beach.
One of our comrades are close by when we land, he looks on fire, to slice some Aliens. But the right after shouting "LET'S GOOOO!", a plane crashes over him, poor him.
We start to run, trying to find a place to hid, meet a huge alien, try to shoot at him, but our weapon fails to work, and try to run in the opposite way but slip because of the sand, we lay on the floor, turn around and see the alien running to us. We try to use our ultimate weapon, and hit the monster in the chest! His dark-blue blood start to spill all over us and react like acid, and still die...

BUT WE WAKE UP, again at this military station in UK, with the same sergeant, everything is the same! We wonder what is going on and end up on the front-lines again, we try to help this guy that get hit by the plane, but by trying to help him, we die smashed by the aircraft. And... wake up in the camp.

We then try to learn from our mistake/experience, and try to escape the war field.
